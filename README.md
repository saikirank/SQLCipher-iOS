SQLCipher-iOS
=============

Quick proof of concept for using SQLCipher on iOS


### Build Instructions
Before opening the Xcode project, you will need to do the following.

In the project's root folder:

    git clone https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher.git
    git clone https://github.com/sqlcipher/openssl-xcode.git

Then add OpenSSL's source code to Xcode by following the instructions in the "Add OpenSSL Source Tree" section at http://sqlcipher.net/ios-tutorial.

After doing so, you should be able to open the project in Xcode and build it.


### What this App does
This App demonstrates how to use SQLcipher by showing how to:
* create an encrypted SQLite database.
* encrypt an existing plaintext SQLite database.

The code is just a proof of concept and isn't production ready. Also, to make the code as simple as possible, the encryption key is hardcoded in the App's source code. Implementers should instead engineer a proper key-derivation scheme using for example a passcode generated by the user.
